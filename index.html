    <p>Hello and welcome to my web development portfolio page. The purpose of this site is used to introduce myself and showcase some of my work in web development and javascript.
        I am a current Computer science student at Weber State Univ working on my second bachelors degree. My current hobbies include reading, listening to audiobooks, cooking, hanging with the family
        playing games, and watching movies. MY wife and I have 3 little ones, 2 teenagae boys and a little girl and 5 pets! Needless to say there's never a dull moment in our home. Anywhom, I decided to
        go down this route becuase I've always had an interest in computers but never took the effort to learn more. My knowledge in the computer science field is at a novice level, I'd say. I have come
        to find out, the more I learn the more I don't know. Therfore, I've accepted I will forever be a student of this field, eager for knowledge. I am excited for YOU to experience this Web Development
        journey with me. I may continue to update this section with more or less content later but for now, this seems to be a good start for my intro paragraph. See ya!!!

        Not sure if I'm allowed to do this but I would like to create an internet persona and try to be 'incognito' on the internet, and not for neferarious resasons, but because I want to
        be private and still use the web. So, journey with Cipher Sage...
