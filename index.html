    <h1>Mike's Webpage</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my web development portfolio page. The purpose of this site is used to introduce myself and showcase some of my work in web development and javascript.
        I am a current CS student at Weber State Univ. My current hobbies include reading, cooking, playing games, and watching movies. My knowledge in the computer science field is 
        very beginner. I have found out the more I learn, the more I don't know. Therfore, I will forever be a student of this field eager for knowledge. I am excited for YOU to experience
        this Web Development journey with me. I may continue to update this with more or less content later but for now, this seems to be a good start for my intro paragraph. See ya!!!
