- Numbers can be added and removed to and from the datasets successfully (arrays)

- Ensure datasets update dynamically on the page as numbers are added and removed (JS functionality)

- Add input validation to handle cases when a number is not found (removal)

- Use a for loop to sum dataset values and division by dataset length (length of array) to correctly
